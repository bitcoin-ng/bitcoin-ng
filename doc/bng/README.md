# Bitcoin Next-Generation

*bitcoin-ng* is a modification of the bitcoin core to make mining memory-hard process (instead of energy hard).

The name of the project is *Bitcoin Next-Generation* (BNG) to reflect the changes made to the original bitcoin protocol. Sometimes we refer to it as *bitcoin-ng* or even shorter - *generation* blockchain.

## Branches and Versions

Initial fork comes from v30.0 of the btc-core. The original is referenced as [upstream](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).

All BNG related branches are prefixed with `bng/`. Hence, main project branch is `bng/main`. Without the prefix it is identical to the upstream bitcoin core.

Initial *generation* release version is `v0.1.0` following semantic versioning scheme. It is prepared under the `bng/v0.1.x` branch. It will accumulate only bug fixes. The same goes for future releases with fixed major / minor in version tuple.

## Improvements Proposals

Changes proposed by BNG are tracked as [Generation Improvement Proposals (GIPs)](doc/bng/gip/README.md).
