 
☐ Set nMinimumChainWork/defaultAssumeValid once BNG mainnet has a stable, widely-agreed high-ish height
    - Choose a checkpoint block hash at a reasonably high height (after launch volatility has settled)
    - Set consensus.nMinimumChainWork to the chainwork at/near that checkpoint to avoid low-work header/chain DoS
    - Set consensus.defaultAssumeValid to that checkpoint block hash to speed up IBD (script checks can be skipped after it)
    consensus.nMinimumChainWork = uint256{};
    consensus.defaultAssumeValid = uint256{};
